<h2>FRONT END PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES</h2>
<pre>

Front end languages include HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
While JQuery is going out of style (modern browsers can now do the same work, but much more quickly than jQuery),
many legacy
projects still use JavaScript library, so don't be surprised to see it on a bootcamp's curriculum. You’ll also learn tons
about responsive design along with typography, layouts, grid system, and color theory. When anticipating types of
projects you’ll work on as a front end developer, think creating and redesigning websites. In order to be a front
end developer (sometimes even called a Javascript developer) you do not need back end development skills. Sites
created by front end developers won’t interact with information stored on a database in order to be functional.
The content will be “fixed,” meaning that large pieces of new data will not be constantly uploaded.
Small business owners and restaurants usually have great examples of static sites.
There are various job positions for front end developers. It’s important to remember that while one title may require
specific duties at one company; it may mean something completely different at another, so it is always best 
to have a clear understanding of what that specific role entails. Search for the following job titles during your job hunt
BACK END PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES
Many back end developers know front end languages such as HTML and CSS but need to use languages such as Java, PHP,
Ruby on Rails, Python, and .Net to get the back end job done.  Back end developers are most focused on a site’s 
responsiveness and speed. These languages are used to create dynamic sites which are different from static sites 
in that these types of websites store database information. Content on the site is constantly changing and updating.
Examples of dynamic sites include Facebook, Twitter, and Google Maps.
According to PayScale, the national average starting salary for back end developers is about $70k. The salary ranges from
about $38k-$117k based on experience, location, and industry. According to SimplyHired, in NYC, starting salary is about $87k
with an approximate range to $120k. Again, not too shabby.

Advantages of frontend programming
The advantages of frontend programming include:

Quick Development
The main advantage of front-end programming is that it can be performed faster. The cutting-edge technological advancements
 and frameworks available for front-end development make tasks faster. 
As a result, creating the final product takes a lot less time. Creating a front-end for an application that already has a
ready and robust backend is a fast and easy proposition. As a result, developing fully functional front-ends is rarely 
a challenge for experienced developers. 

Secure Environment
Fron-tend development is also beneficial because all front-end frameworks offer a highly secure environment for coding.
 It is particularly advantageous for users as they can preserve code and websites across multiple browsers. 

Fast Response
The new framework technology used by developers lets them easily create fast response features that facilitate the efficient
 reaction, response, and functioning of applications.
